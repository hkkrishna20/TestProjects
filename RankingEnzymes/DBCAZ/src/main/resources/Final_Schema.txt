CAZy Based ranking of Fungal Lignocellulolytic abilities:

##Metadata
# File-1: Ranking Fungi_CAZymes
Genome_code: Represents the short name of the microorganism
Name: Complete scientific name of the organism
Published: Reference of the genome
Assembly Length	Genes: Total length of the published genome
Genes: Total number of genes

File-2: CAZymes 
Annotations/Genomes:
Genome code: (First three letters in the generic name and two letters in the species name)
Annotations: AA class enzymes, GH-class enzymes, GT-class enzymes, CE-class enzymes, CBM-class enzymes, PL-class enzymes, DOC-class enzymes with total number of genes encoding for the enzymes

Queries:
a) Calculate total number of individual class enzymes (For ex: AA-class enzymes) among the microorganisms genomes using the Genome code
   For Ex: Sclsc1 (Genome code); total number of AA encoding genes 58 and rank the fungal genomes based on the total number of individual class enzyme number
 
b) Arrange the microorganisms in descending order based on the total number of genes encoding in each enzyme class
